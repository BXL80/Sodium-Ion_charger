# Sodium-Ion_charger
Starting my journey as an electronical hobbyist on the way of DIY Sodium-Ion cell charger

I'll give my best on two different "brand" :

The first circuit has to be the simple charging circuit equipped with output pins.
  -There must be a voltage regulator that can be powered either by USB-C or two Power pins.
  -There must be an overvoltage pulse protection (due to electrostatic), which will be a TVS (Transiente Voltage Supressor) diode.
